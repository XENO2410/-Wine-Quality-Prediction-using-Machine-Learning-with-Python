# Wine Quality Prediction

This project implements a Wine Quality Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. The Random Forest model is utilized for prediction. Below is an overview of the project workflow and the libraries used.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning techniques. The system is built with the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Importing necessary libraries and the dataset.
2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and creating relevant features from the data.
5. **Model Training**: Training the Random Forest model on the processed data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using accuracy scores and other metrics.

## Libraries Used

- **numpy**: This library is used for numerical operations, providing support for arrays and matrices.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation tool that helps with data analysis and cleaning.
- **seaborn**: A visualization library used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: Helps in splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **sklearn.ensemble**: Provides the Random Forest algorithm for prediction.
- **sklearn.metrics**: Used for evaluating the accuracy of the model and other performance metrics.

## Workflow

1. **Data Import and Exploration**: The dataset is imported, and initial exploration is conducted to understand its structure and content.
2. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Using `seaborn` to create visualizations that show correlations between features and the target variable.
   - Identifying patterns and insights from the visualizations.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables, if any.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Creating new features that could be relevant for the prediction.
   - Transforming existing features to improve model performance.
5. **Data Splitting**: 
   - Using `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Training**: 
   - Training the Random Forest model on the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Predicting on the test data and calculating the accuracy score and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict wine quality. The use of Random Forest and `seaborn` provides a robust framework for handling, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
